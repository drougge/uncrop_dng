Update the DefaultCrop in a DNG to match ActiveArea.

Apparently some software (LightRoom, DarkTable, no doubt others) enforces
the DefaultCrop, which may have been set against your wishes by the camera.
This program sets it to match the ActiveArea. Might not work on all files,
tested on the files from the Pentax Q7 (with the 03 fish-eye lens, which it
crops).

Backup your DNG before trying this.
